                Dear <!-- Basecamp / Runway / Launch Space / SETsquared --> team,
              </p>
              <p style="margin:0 0 10px 0;">
                I hope you are well. I am <strong>Jayeetra Bhattacharjee</strong>, currently studying MSc Business Analytics at the University of Bristol, and together with my co‑founder <strong>Amit Kiran Deb</strong>, who is completing an MSc in Cybersecurity at the University of Bristol, we are building <strong>TwoTable</strong>, a dating and venue start‑up that turns serious matches into escrow‑backed date‑night bookings for local restaurants and bars.
              </p>
              <p style="margin:0;">
                We are reaching out to ask for your help with incubation, mentoring and, in time, funding for this student‑led startup. Below is a short overview of what we are building, the traction we have so far, and the kind of support we are hoping to explore with you.

              <!-- OVERVIEW -->

                Overview
              </div>
              <p style="margin:0 0 10px 0; font-weight:600; color:#B80B0B;">
                We are tackling two connected problems at once: broken online dating for people, and empty, risky tables for venues.
              </p>

              <!-- DATER PROBLEM / SOLUTION -->
              <h3 style="margin:18px 0 6px 0; font-size:15px; color:#441010;">Solving modern dating problems</h3>
              <p style="margin:0 0 6px 0;">
                Traditional dating apps generate ghosting, scams, swipe fatigue, bots and unsafe or fake dates, especially in large cities. TwoTable focuses on <strong>fewer, higher‑quality dates</strong> in carefully selected venues rather than endless swiping and chat that rarely becomes a real meeting.
              </p>
              <ul style="margin:6px 0 10px 18px; padding:0;">
                <li style="margin-bottom:4px;">
                  Escrow‑style payment model: deposits are held until the date happens, reducing no‑shows and fraud for both guests and venues, and making each booking feel safer and more serious.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom:4px;">
                  Advanced backend logic: instead of simple distance‑based matching, we use time‑aware matching, venue capacity and opening hours, powered by Google APIs and our own availability and scheduling engine.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom:4px;">
                  Curated, real‑world dates: users reserve actual tables with verified venues, avoiding vague “let’s meet somewhere” plans that easily collapse into ghosting or last‑minute cancellations.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <!-- VENUE PROBLEM / SOLUTION -->
              <h3 style="margin:18px 0 6px 0; font-size:15px; color:#441010;">Creating reliable upside for venues</h3>
              <p style="margin:0 0 6px 0;">
                Restaurants and bars face quiet hours, last‑minute no‑shows and unpredictable revenue from reservations. TwoTable is designed as a low‑risk, incremental revenue channel with incentives aligned between guests and venues.
              </p>
              <ul style="margin:6px 0 10px 18px; padding:0;">
                <li style="margin-bottom:4px;">
                  Empty tables converted into fixed payouts: venues receive a clear, pre‑agreed payout per seated date, with no upfront charges.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom:4px;">
                  No‑show protection: deposits and our escrow model ensure that last‑minute cancellations do not leave venues with zero revenue.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom:4px;">
                  Commission per guest and quiet‑hour targeting: we deliberately steer demand into off‑peak periods, adding revenue without cannibalising their already busy times.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <!-- TRACTION -->

                  200–300 venues visited
                </span>

                  ~500 venues in discussion
                </span>
                <br /><br />
                We have personally visited and spoken with approximately 200–300 venues across Bristol and London, and the consistent feedback is that they are interested in a first meeting and pilot. In parallel, we are now in active discussion with around 500 venues regarding potential partnerships, including early‑stage conversations with a Gordon Ramsay restaurant in London about piloting our model.
              </div>
              <p style="margin:0 0 10px 0;">
                Alongside venue outreach, we have begun discussions with major ecosystem players including <strong>OpenTable</strong>, <strong>SevenRooms</strong> and <strong>Stripe</strong>. These conversations are focused on reservations and payments integrations, compliance and building a scalable, secure infrastructure from the beginning.
              </p>

              <!-- FINANCIAL MODEL -->
              <h3 style="margin:18px 0 6px 0; font-size:15px; color:#441010;">Financial model and off‑peak economics</h3>
              <p style="margin:0 0 6px 0;">
                To help restaurants understand the value of their quiet hours, we have built a dedicated financial model and online tool that shows how much revenue is lost because tables sit empty during off‑peak times. Venues can plug in their own labour, rent, average spend and capacity, and see how different TwoTable booking volumes translate into recovered revenue, month by month and year by year.
              </p>
              <p style="margin:0 0 10px 0;">
                This financial model is the same one we use in our partner outreach, and it underpins our commercial discussions with venues. You can see the public entry point to this model here:
                <a href="https://file-organizer-lite.replit.app/" target="_blank" style="color:#B80B0B;">
                  calculate how much a venue is losing to empty tables
                </a>.
              </p>

              <!-- PRODUCT / TECH -->
              <h3 style="margin:18px 0 6px 0; font-size:15px; color:#441010;">Product and technical approach</h3>
              <p style="margin:0 0 6px 0;">
                TwoTable is being built as a scalable, mobile‑first marketplace: a modern app for daters layered on top of robust backend services for matching, availability, payments and risk management. Our scheduling engine is designed around time windows, Google API data and venue constraints, rather than radius‑only search.
              </p>
              <p style="margin:0 0 10px 0;">
                Between us, we cover full‑stack engineering, cybersecurity, data and product. We are already prototyping and testing flows with real users and venues, while respecting current student‑visa constraints until we can fully launch and trade.
              </p>

              <!-- ASK -->
              <h3 style="margin:18px 0 6px 0; font-size:15px; color:#441010;">How your support could help</h3>
              <p style="margin:0 0 6px 0;">
                We would be very grateful for the opportunity to connect with your team and explore:
              </p>
              <ul style="margin:6px 0 10px 18px; padding:0;">
                <li style="margin-bottom:4px;">Whether TwoTable is a good fit for your incubator and startup support programmes.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom:4px;">Mentoring on go‑to‑market, fundraising and marketplace strategy in the UK hospitality and consumer tech space.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom:4px;">Guidance on the right timing and structure for company setup and investment, given my current student‑visa status and our planned Graduate‑visa pathway.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom:4px;">Potential access to early‑stage funding or competitions to validate and scale our initial pilots in Bristol.</li>
              </ul>

              <p style="margin:0 0 10px 0;">
                Our immediate plan is to run structured pilots with a focused group of Bristol venues, demonstrate clear no‑show reduction and revenue uplift, and then expand carefully across London and other UK cities. Being part of your ecosystem would significantly increase our chances of doing this in a disciplined and investor‑ready way.
              </p>
